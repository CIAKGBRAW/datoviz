# Meshes and triangulations

Datoviz can display meshes, polygons, triangulations, and planar straight-line graphs (PSLG). It integrates natively:

* the [**triangle** C library](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), developed by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk, used to compute Delaunay triangulations;
* the [**earcut** C++ library](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp), developed by Mapbox, used to compute triangulations of polygons.

Datoviz also provides a few simple mesh generation functions for basic shapes (spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and so on) and regular 2D surfaces.

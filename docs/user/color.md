# Colormaps

Visky has built-in support for many continuous colormaps and discrete color palettes. It comes with most colormaps provided by the Python libraries matplotlib, bokeh, and colorcet.

!!! note
    The colormaps are stored in a 256x256 24-bit texture. Each of the 256 rows of the texture contains one colormap or several color palettes. Significant empty space is reserved to future colormaps and custom, user-defined colormaps.

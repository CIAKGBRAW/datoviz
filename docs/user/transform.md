## Coordinate systems and transformations

A complex 2D plot may define many different coordinate systems. Visky provides a few functions that help you transform points from one coordinate system to the other.

## Transformations between coordinate systems

There are two different ways of considering a given transformation:

* A mapping of a geometric point P to another point Q in a given reference space.
* A mapping of a triplet of coordinates representing a point P in a coordinate system A to another triplet of coordinates representing the same geometric point in a different coordinate system B.

When dealing with 2D coordinate systems in the context of scientific plotting, we find it easier to think in terms of transformations of fixed points between different coordinate systems.

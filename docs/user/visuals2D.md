# 2D plotting

This page provides a list of all 2D visuals in Visky.

!!! note
    All 2D visuals can also be used in a 3D scene (using a 3D controller such as arcball or one of the cameras). Position data is always specified in 3 dimensions, even with 2D visuals, in which case a `z=0` component is used for all points.
